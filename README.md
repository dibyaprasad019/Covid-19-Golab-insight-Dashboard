# Covid-19-Golab-insight-Dashboard
🔹 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Excel)

Removed duplicates and missing values

Standardized formats and created derived metrics:

New Confirmed Cases

Survival Ratio

Test-Confirmed Ratio

Active Cases


Final Project Report

🔹 2. Interactive Visual Dashboards (Tableau & Power BI)

Time-series trends of confirmed, death, and recovery cases

Global heat maps highlighting case intensity region-wise

Top 10 countries comparison (Deaths, Recoveries, Actives)

KPI Cards: Total Cases, Total Deaths, Test-Confirmed Ratio, etc.

Vaccination vs Active Case Correlation
